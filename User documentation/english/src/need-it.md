# What do I need to use Mostro?

To use Mostro, all you need is a Lightning Network-compatible wallet.

You don't have to be an expert in [Nostr](https://nostr.com/). If you are, great! But if not, you can still use Mostro without any issues, as it is designed to be simple and intuitive for all users.

To perform bitcoin exchanges, you'll use a [Mostro client](./clients.md). Although each client has its own features, in most of them, you won't need to have a pre-created Nostr private key. To ensure the security and [privacy](./privacy.md) of your transactions, the client should automatically generate a new private key each time you perform a bitcoin exchange, without the need for additional setup or interventions on your part.
