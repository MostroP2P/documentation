# Accepted Currencies and Payment Methods

Since Mostro is a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, it is technically available to anyone who wants to use it, as long as there is a counterparty interested in making the exchange. You can post or take offers in any currency and with any payment method.

Mostro uses [yadio.io](https://yadio.io/) as a reference for currency prices, which allows the exchange of over 90 currencies listed on that platform. If your currency does not appear on [yadio.io](https://yadio.io/), you can request them to add it. However, if this is not possible, you can still use Mostro to exchange bitcoin; you'll just need to create an order by setting a fixed amount of sats in exchange for a fixed amount of your currency.
