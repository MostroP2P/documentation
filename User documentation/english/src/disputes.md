# Dispute Management

If your counterparty is unresponsive, you suspect a scam attempt, or a misunderstanding arises that you are unable to resolve, you can initiate a dispute.

When you start a dispute, you will be attended to by the administrator of the Mostro instance you are using, or by a person designated by that administrator (solver). Upon opening the dispute, Mostro will provide you with a unique token number, and your counterparty will receive a different one. Both tokens will be revealed to the administrator handling the dispute. When the administrator contacts you and your counterparty, they will tell you your token, allowing you to verify that they are the designated person and ensuring they are not an impostor.

There is no standard method for resolving disputes across all Mostro instances. Each administrator can decide how to manage disputes generated in their instance and what evidence to request from users to make the most appropriate decision.

When the administrator decides which user is in the right, they will have Mostro release the sats to the appropriate user. Administrators do not charge any extra fee for resolving disputes.

It is important to note that disputes are not automatically opened in any case. The users involved must initiate them before the [hold invoice](./hold-invoice.md) paid by the seller expires, so that the administrator has enough time to request evidence from both parties and make an appropriate decision, as time continues to run from when the order is accepted and does not stop when a dispute is opened. The administrator must resolve it before the time expires, so users should not wait too long to initiate it. You can read more about time frames [here](./times.md).
