# Support and Contact

Mostro is not a company but an Open Source project maintained by its community, so it does not have a technical support department. However, there is a community you can reach out to if needed.

If you have any questions, you can ask in the Telegram groups:

- Mostro community: [https://t.me/MostroP2P](https://t.me/MostroP2P)
- Mostro devs: [https://t.me/mostro_dev](https://t.me/mostro_dev)
    
We also have a [group on Nostr](https://www.nostrchat.io/channel/30d1992102c567d143a3df32ca985a16e9d8576e947e687b757848aeca5d9a7b).
