# Do I need to register or do KYC?

NO! Bitcoin was born as "a peer-to-peer electronic cash system," and we are proud to support that principle. None of your personal data is required. Additionally, Mostro instances do not have access to conversations between users, so it is not possible to collect any personal information. You can find more information about how your privacy is protected on Mostro [here](./privacy.md).
