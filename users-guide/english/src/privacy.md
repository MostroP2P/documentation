# Privacy in Mostro

The communication between Mostrod and users is carried out through the [Mostro clients](./clients.md) using [NIP-59](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md) messages. These messages have their content and the senderâ€™s public key encrypted and "wrapped" by an ephemeral key, preventing the identity of whoever is interacting with Mostro from being publicly revealed. To enhance privacy, the [Mostro clients](./clients.md) should automatically generate a new private key for users for each order they take or create. Thus, when Mostro sends [NIP-59](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/59.md) messages to users, the generated event will display a public key that will only be used for that transaction, guaranteeing a new identity for each exchange and preventing buy and sell transactions from being associated with a single person.

The [Mostro clients](./clients.md) will not share users' private keys with any Mostro instance, and consequently with its administrator, under any circumstances.

The communication between the buyer and seller during a transaction is client-to-client, using messages encrypted with the [NIP-44](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md) algorithm. Although this reveals the public keys involved in the communication, users always must use a new Nostr identity for each transaction, ensuring their privacy. Additionally, these messages are not sent to Mostrod, meaning that it does not access or collect users' personal information.

Moreover, [NIP-44](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md) allows the client to create a *conversation key* associated with the key pair of the two users involved in a transaction, to which only they have access. This *conversation key* have a copy of the conversation between both users, and in case of a [dispute](./disputes.md), if the users wish, they can provide it to the administrator handling their case as evidence of the facts.
