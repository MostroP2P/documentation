# Can I cancel an order?

If you created an order and it hasn't been taken yet, you can cancel it.

If the order has already been taken, or if you have taken an order and decide not to proceed, you will need to initiate a cooperative cancellation with your counterparty. If both parties agree, Mostro will cancel the [hold invoice](./hold-invoice.md) paid by the seller, and the sats will be returned to them.

In case your counterparty does not want to cancel, you can initiate a [dispute](./disputes.md).
