# Exchange Fees and Limits

Each operator of a Mostro instance can set their own fees and limits per transaction, fostering competition among Mostro instances and allowing users to select the one that best suits their needs.

The Mostro node currently active on mainnet (`npub1ykvsmrmw2hk7jgxgy64zr8tfkx4nnjhq9eyfxdlg3caha3ph0skq6jr3z0`) charges a 0.3% fee to both the buyer and the seller for each transaction. Additionally, it allows exchanges ranging from 100 sats to 20000 sats per operation.
