# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mostro!  
Mostro is not a company but an Open Source project, driven and maintained by its community, so any type of contribution is valuable and helpful to its users.

While we suggest some areas where you can collaborate, feel free to propose any improvement you think may benefit the project:
- **Documentation:** Help improve the documentation so that more people can understand what Mostro is and how to use it.
- **Translations:** If you are multilingual, you can translate Mostro's [clients](./clients.md) or contribute to the documentation in other languages.
- **Development:** In the [Mostro project](https://github.com/MostroP2P) you can find various repositories and programming languages. If you're unsure where to start, check out the "good first issue" lists to get involved.
- **Bug reporting:** If you detect any errors or unexpected behavior, reporting them is greatly helpful. This contributes to improving the stability and quality of the project.
- **Improvement proposals:** If you have ideas to enhance Mostro, we invite you to share them. Many key features have arisen thanks to suggestions from the community. You can propose your ideas in the [support groups](./support-and-contacts.md), or open an issue in the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/MostroP2P). If you believe it will spark significant discussion, then start a discussion in that repository.
- **Content creation:** If you have skills in content creation, you can make video tutorials or written guides to help users make the most of Mostro.
- **Social media outreach:** Sharing information about Mostro on social media helps increase its visibility and attract more people interested in contributing or using it.
- **Donations:** If you prefer to financially support the development and maintenance of Mostro, you can make a donation to `mostro@getalby.com`.
