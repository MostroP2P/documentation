# Quick Start ðŸš€

On this site, you'll find information on how to use [Mostro](https://mostro.network/), a peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange platform on the Lightning Network for any local currency. It operates on [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) and does not require KYC procedures.

## Quick Start Guide ðŸš€

1. **Have a Lightning Network-compatible wallet.**

2. **Open any [Mostro client](./clients.md).** 

3. **Follow the instructions of the [client](./clients.md):**
   - Log in with a Nostr key; some [Mostro clients](./clients.md) will create one for you!
   - Find or create bitcoin buy/sell offers.
   - Wait for an interested user.
   - If you're buying sats, provide the invoice where you will receive the sats.
   - If you're selling sats, pay the [hold invoice](./hold-invoice.md) (the sats will remain locked in your wallet until the end of the process).
   - Talk to your counterparty. Agree on how to exchange the fiat. This is a [private](./privacy.md) process.
   - Complete the exchange.
   - If your counterparty does not respond, start a [dispute](./disputes.md). 
   - [Rate](./reputation.md) your counterparty. You will also be [rated](./reputation.md).
